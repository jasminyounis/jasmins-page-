  <p style="color:white;" Been playing around with p5.js to learn about how to create interactive art. So I decided to mess around with the examples they had on the site.</p>
<p style="color:white;" Usually with my work, I like to create detail oriented subjects, but with being in Shelter-in-place, I'm taking this time to learn about other styles.</p>
